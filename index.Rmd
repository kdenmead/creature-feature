Hi, my name is Kay Denmead. I am an Evolutionary Genomics and Bioinformatics student, Spring 2024, about to graduate with a B.S. in Biology with a minor in Anthropology and a specialization in creative writing. I am hoping that R will be useful for my future career in science and I am excited to keep learning more about how to use R throughout the semester. 

Here are some bird species I work with in the Stager Lab on campus, the first picture are Purple Martins and the second are Dark-eyed Juncos, banding codes PUMA and DEJU respectively.
